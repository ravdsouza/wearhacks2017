A virtual reality personal assistant that combines the usage of the Myo gesture controller and the Utopia 360 VR headset. NART allows the user to control the VR set by doing hand gestures such as left/right/up/down/select etc. Users can access their calendar, to-do list, health information and more. We also made a website (with a link to a YouTube video) to display NART and its features.
